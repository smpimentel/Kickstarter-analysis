# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this challange was to see how different play campaigns compared in relation to thier launch dates and their funding goals. 
Using the Kickstarter dataset we were able to visualize different campaign's outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It would seem that the besed time to launch a campaign is in the spring and early summer months

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It seemed that the plays that had a lower goal had a greater chance of success. Although that isn't surprising it seemed that 1000 - 15000 was
the consistant max that seemed to have a greater chance of succeeding than failing. Even tough we did see in some of the higher goal campaigns
where there were a greater amount of success than failures it is important to note that they are a small pool of data and can not be taken as a
reliable outcome. It seemed that the majority of the campaigns were in the 1000-10000 range and they were more times than not successful. Our largest 
goal group was the 1000-5000 group and there was a 72% success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenges that I personally ran into was making sure all my formulas were pointing to the right columns and in a way that was efficient
and didn't leave me retyping multiple cells over again.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There seemed to be the greatest amount of campaigns during the summer time, but also had the greatest chance for success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Something that seemed to be clear is that as that the higher the goal the greater the chance of the campaign failing

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It is a small pool of data when it comes to plays. In some cases we saw that there was more successful campaigns than failures in the larger goals
but there were only 5-12 campaigns we were comparing. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
it would have been interesting to see how the success rate correlated throughout the years to see if the success rate in these categories increased 
or decreased over time. especially comparing to the film industry and if we saw in increase there over the years and a decrease in plays.
